# Hangman game

I was tasked with creating a basic hangman game that runs in the terminal using Java. The structure of the code is broken down into separate classes, all of which have the own roles. 
<br><br> For example:

* Dictionary class - _responsible for storing your words with a method to randomly select a word._
* Results class - _responsible for displaying the results of the guess._
* UserInput class - _responsible for interacting with the player e.g. reads input._
* Main class - _responsible for connecting these classes together and running the game._
